# plant3_sensor_phectemp
Plantcubed new PH/EC/Temp probe assemble driver code. This is to be used with the Plantcubed Corporation PHEC product. This will greatly enhance any EC/PH measurement system, but was specifically designed for MIT OpenAG Food Computer as a more reliable replacement for the existing specificed hardware.

## Required Changes
At the moment, you must manually integrate the code into the OpenAg microcontroller code. The means copying the files to the src directory. Note that the module_handler.cpp and .h files will be overwritten.
